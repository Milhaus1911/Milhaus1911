### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently an IT specialist in Auckland, New Zealand. I've been working in IT since 2018 after I completed a BSc in Computer Science and Physics at UoA.

My goal is to use my Github [pages](https://milhaus1911.github.io/) (theres just a place holder there at the moment) as a blog and record of projects I've worked on. My current interest is mainly in cyber security, but will try to post about anything I find interesting really. 

I can be reached on Twitter @laytso
